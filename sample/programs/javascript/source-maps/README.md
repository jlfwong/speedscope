## Source Map Test Project

This directory contains test files used to test whether the remapping of
performance profiles using sourcemaps work correctly.

Run `npm run build` to build the artifacts, then open the appropriate files in
the `html` directory in whatever browser you're testing.

The idea is to sourcemaps generated by a variety of tools, and also to take
profiles from a variety of browsers, and hopefully see that they all get 
remapped as expected.

This project is set up to go through three levels of source-map indirection,
and also using multiple different build chains.

1. TypeScript -> JavaScript source generation
2. JavaScript source -> JavaScript bundling
3. Minification

Some bundlers will swap the order of steps 2 & 3, or potentially merge them,
but it's complex yet realistic enough that this will hoepfully suss out 
problems.
