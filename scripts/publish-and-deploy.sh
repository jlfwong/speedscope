# NOTE: This part is almost-but-not-quite-automatable using a command like this:
#
#    gh release create "$tagname" --title "$tagname" --notes "$changelog_update"
#      --attach "dist/release/speedscope-$version.zip"
#
# There are two problems.
#
# 1. The "--attach" flag doesn't exit
# 2. I don't want the changelog notes to include the version and date like they do in CHANGELOG.md
#
# If 1. was solveable, then 2. would be easy to work-around.
